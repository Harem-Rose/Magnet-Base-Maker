v07 Introduced code to allow the creation of Multi-base bases.
Multi-Basing can be used for its original purpose of making multi-base bases, or can be used to create "rebase" rings. 

Multi-Base Bases
  The intent of a multi-base base is to allow the user to add nested smaller bases on a large base. This can be used for smaller scale wargaming, or can be utilized to add markers to a base for a large, multi-wound model
  
Rebase Ring
  Sometimes, models' rules in wargames are updated to require a larger base. A larger base with a gap for the model's previous base can be made
  
  
To Utilize Multi-Basing mode:
  1. Locate the variable "MakeMultiBase"
  2. Change the line to read as follows (Case Sensitive)
    MakeMultiBase = 1;
  3. The following variables are used to change the behavior of Multi-Base Mode
    MultiBaseDistancePercent | Between 0-100. Changes the distance from the center of the base that the minibase-slots will exist.
    MultiBaseWidth | The Width of the minibase-slots. The tool only supports circular minibase-slots at this time.
    MultiBaseDepth | How deep you want the minibase-slots to recess into the main base. 
    MultiBaseCount | The number of minibase-slots you would like. Bases will be added in a circle by default. 2 will provide a base at 0°, and a base at 180°. 3 will be at 0°, 120°, 240°. Etc.
    MultiBaseAddCenter | This will add a minibase-slots directly in the center of the main base. This minibase-slot will be in addition to the MultiBaseCount. For instance, if you have 2 for MultiBaseCount, and this is enabled, you will have a 3rd minibase-slot
   
    MultiBaseMagnetWidth | This will configure the width of a slot in the main base at the bottom of the minibase-slots that a magnet can be inserted to secure the minibases
    MultiBaseMagnetDepth | Same as above, but for the depth of the magnet
    
    MultiBaseCrescent | Changes the degree arc in which the multibases can be. At 360, the behavior described in the line above about MultiBaseCount will apply. At 180, 2 will provide a minibase-slot at 0°, and 90°. 3 will be at 0°, 60°, 120°
    MultiBaseRotate | Only needed if you feel the need to align the minibase-slots differently so they either do, or do not line up with the magnet studs below
  4. There are additional variables further down under the "Advanced MultiBase Variables", which is in the larger "Advanced User Variables" Section
    MultiBaseExtraWidth | Extra width is added to the minibase-slots to allow for resin expansion that occurs during printing and curing
    MultiBaseExtraDepth | Same as above but for depth
    MultiBaseMagnetWidthExtra | Extra width is added to the minibase-slots' magnet hole to allow for resin expansion that occurs during printing and curing
    MultiBaseMagnetWidthExtra | Same as above but for depth
    MultiBaseCircleEdgeFaces | Can set the amount of edges added by the tool to the circles. Less will give a more polygon appearance, more will be smoother. Theoretically could be used to change minibase-slotsshape to be hexagonal
